<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

This is a repository that contains all of my university stuff throughout the years of studying. It includes, but not limited to all of my homework tasks, projects, resources, documentation and much more. On the second term of year one I have came up with a near-perfect file system which is structured in the following format:

- yearN-termN
  - CourseName
    - taskName
      - report.docx
      - resources
      - solution
      - other files
  - ...

Now, to understand the system a bit more, let's dive a bit deeper into it. To understand how it works we first need to understand what each part means. So, basically the root directory is broken up into term folders. One term - one folder. In each term folder there must be one folder for each course and possibly some important documents in root. In each course folder there must be a course syllabi as well as a docx report sample. The folders are for tasks or notes.
