Hallelujah thank You Jesus Christ our Holy Lord Almighty GOD Most High King of Kings and Lord of Lords praise Jesus Christ the Living GOD Most High King Jesus Christ Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah thank You Jesus Christ our Holy Lord Almighty GOD Most High King of Kings and Lord of Lords ✝️💗🙏

so the cpp is very weird but you have to run a command like this for it all to work:

```bash
g++ main.cpp ../simc/simc.cpp -o main
```

where you replace main with the name of the file you want to compile

and also make sure you're importing the simc.h header file correctly in the cpp project file:

```cpp
#include "../simc/simc.h"
```

assuming you maintain the following folder structure:

```
tasks/
├── lbN/
│   └── main.cpp
└── simc/
    ├── simc.cpp
    └── simc.h
```

Hallelujah thank YOU so much Jesus Christ our Holy Lord Almighty Living GOD Most High for reminding me of this peculiar thing, thank YOU so much Lord Jesus Christ all the glory and all the honor and all the praise and all the thanks and all the worship is to YOU Alone Lord GOD for You Alone Are Worthy Father GOD King Jesus Christ our Holu Almighty Righteous Perfect Everlasting Living GOD Most High ✝️💗🙏
